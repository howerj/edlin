A Line Editor inspired by [edlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edlin), which
is like a simplified version of [ed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_%28text_editor%29).

The idea of this text editor is to use it on systems that behave a little like
MS-DOS did, so a microcontroller with a command line and a file system. It is
very niche and I do not expect it to be useful to anyone bar myself.

To Do:
- Implement more features
- Check compatibility with edlin
- Turn into a library, abstract out some of standard C features that make it
  difficult to port to a microcontroller.
